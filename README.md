this is an example of a ReadMe file.

//Question1 = Before toString, the program was printing out a series of numbers associated with the class. This is because nothing was currently assigned to it, so it was assigned its own memory.  

//Question2 = The three fields are title, author, and pages. The default values are "Title", "Best Author", and 10.

//Question3 = The default constructor manually added in the information for a dog, using the three fields. The nondefault constructor sets up the information so that someone could add to it through the main file. 

//Question4 = The override is needed to ensure that if the wrong function is used after toString (such as attempting to use an int value) the error will be caught immediately instead of turning into a subtle bug.

//Question5 = Encapsulation is preferred as it ensures the wrong person cannot access and change the class. For example, in private company code, you wouldn't want a random person to be able to change all of the fields, adding getters/setters allows you to determine what others have access to rather than give them access to everything. A validation rule could be to add a password that people need to access the setter.
